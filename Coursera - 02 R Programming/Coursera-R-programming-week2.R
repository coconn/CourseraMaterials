# repeat only ends if you call a break

# for loop with a hard limit on iterations is probably better in case there's a problem with the alg and isn't converging

# Lectures: functions

# functions are going in their own text files, so see functions-week1.R

# the '...' argument

# when binding a value to a symbol, R searches through environments (lists of symbols and values).  first searches through the global enviro (workspace things you've defined/loaded).  if no match there, searches the namespaces of currently loaded packages (see search()).

# functions and objects can have the same name
lm <- 5
lm
lm(airquality)


#####################################################################
# Lectures: scoping

# lexical scoping in R (scoping rules determine how a value gets bound to a symbol/free variable); how R uses the search list is related to this.  

# free variables' values are searched for in the environment where the function was defined.

f <- function(x){
      y<-2
      y^2 + g(x)
}

g<-function(x){
      x*y
}
f(3) # ans = 34, because g(3)=30 where y=10, but y^2 within f = 4 because y=2, 30+4=34


# scoping rules and optimizing functions
# constructor function that constructs the objective function
# carries everything with it like baggage aside from the parameter

      params <- fixed

            sigma <- params[2]
            a <- -0.5 * length(data) * log(2 * pi * sigma^2)
            b <- -0.5 * sum((data-mu)^2) / (sigma^2)
            -(a + b)
      }
}

set.seed(1); normals <- rnorm(100, 1, 2)
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals)
nLL # shows defining environment at the bottom of the description (address of where it lives in the memory)
ls(environment(nLL)) # what's in that environment

# try this out
optim(c(mu = 0, sigma = 1), nLL)$par

# fix sigma
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(FALSE, 2))
optimize(nLL, c(-1, 3))$minimum

# fix mu
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(1, FALSE))
optimize(nLL, c(1e-6, 10))$minimum

# Objective functions can be "built" that contain all of the necessary data for evaluating the function
# No need to carry around long argument listsâ€”useful for interactive and exploratory work
# Code can be simplified and cleaned up

# Week 1 Lectures and Quiz

## history
# John Chambers at Bell Labs in the late 70s - S language
# R is a version of the S language

## random commands/things I didn't know

# complete.cases
?complete.cases
x <- c(1,2,NA,4)
y <- c("a","b","c",NA)
good <- complete.cases(x,y)
x[good]

# [] vs [[]]: [[]] extracts the actual thing in the list (like, the vector or the string), and [] ALWAYS returns the exact same type of data as the thing it's drawing from, so [1] of a list returns a list of one item, that might be a vector, etc.

# speed up reading in your data
# colClasses makes things a lot faster
initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows=100)
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
tabALL <- read.table("datatable.txt", colClasses = classes)
# nrows is also really helpful, not for speed but helps R figure out how to parse its memory


## quiz stuff

quizdata <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coursework and Resources/Coursework - Yr 5/Coursera - 02 R Programming/hw1_data.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

head(quizdata, n=2)
tail(quizdata, n=2)
quizdata$Ozone[47]

sum(is.na(quizdata$Ozone))
mean(na.omit(quizdata$Ozone))

subsetforquiz1 <- subset(quizdata, quizdata$Ozone > 31 & Temp >90)
mean(na.omit(subsetforquiz1$Solar.R))

subsetforquiz2 <- subset(quizdata, quizdata$Month == 6)
mean(na.omit(subsetforquiz2$Temp))

subsetforquiz3 <- subset(quizdata, quizdata$Month == 5)
max(na.omit(subsetforquiz3$Ozone))
